Create interface for fly and quackable
Create class with swim and display methods

now,
* MallardDuck will fly,quack and display don't swim,so implements fly,quackable extends display
* RedheadDuck follows same
* RubberDuck extends displays and implements quackable
* DecoyDuck extends displays

* but sill redutant codes are there why because MallardDuck and RedHeadDuck shares same, so it have the same method implementation
for the fly and quack.
* Inheritance and Interface didn't work well. (the way we use is causing the problem)
